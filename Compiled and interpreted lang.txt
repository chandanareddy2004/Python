1.Compiled language follows at least two levels to get from source code to execution where as an Interpreted language follows one step to get from source code to execution.
2.A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it where as an interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language.
3.The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.
4.In a compiled language, the code can be executed by the CPU, where as in Interpreted languages the program cannot be compiled, it is interpreted.
5.Compiled language delivers better performance where as Interpreted language delivers slower performance.
6. Example of compiled language – C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.
   Example of Interpreted language – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.
